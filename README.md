# HyperLogLog-Algo

HyperLogLog Implementation

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the HyperLogLog (HLL) algorithm â€” a probabilistic data structure used for cardinality estimation (i.e., estimating the number of distinct elements in a dataset).

Instead of storing all elements, HyperLogLog uses hashing and bit-pattern analysis to provide an approximate distinct count with very low memory usage.
